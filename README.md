### Hi there, I'm WittsEnd2 👋 

## I'm into everything Embbedded Systems and Cyber Security

- 💭 Always working on something related to embedded systems or cyber security. 
- 💻 I play in many CTF Competitions (and create challenges for some too). 
- 👯 Created a cyber security blog called RagnarSecurity: [Go see my blog](https://medium.com/@ragnarsecurity). 
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Learn as much about baremetal firmware development and the Linux Kernel as possible
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with ⚾ and 🏋️
